She understand the account/customer's processes and expectations. She communicates well with frontline staff. She is not shy of working across multiple shifts and has gone above and beyond with overseeing events and special projects.\n\nAreas of opportunity: Ivves communication needs major improvement. She does not communicate effectively and/or on-time, does not acknowledge all emails and requests across all departments: Ops, HR, Upper Management, Recruiting. Ivves has not attended frontline interviews scheduled with candidates and/or communicated regarding timing/scheduling. Ivves has not been involved with 4Insite during her 1st month, other than performing 3 internal audits. She missed two safety reports regarding frontline staff that results in the Account Manager reporting to EHS. She is very hands-on with the staff and the account, leaving her no time to focus on 4Insite, administrative tasks, and timely communication."

I was the mentor during the program and Katie did well through the program. Now that it is over, I do believe there is more to desired. I am not seeing this person take any real ownership of any part of the operations of the site. Yes, she will do whatever is asked of her although any time cleaning is involved, the attitude and demeanor of this individual changes and not for the good.\n\nOf course, as a Manager, you do not want to be cleaning, but the needs of the business far outweigh (or should) the wants of the manager. It does not seem like Katie can either hold up for the entire day or chooses not to as I am unaware of a full week passing by in which she has put in a full weeks worth of time (40hrs).\n\nI would really like to see Kathryn, while at my site and waiting to be placed in a permanent role, gravitate toward a specific thing and take it over. Fully dive in to this specific thing and tear it down to rebuild it bigger, badder and better. The site cannot afford her compensation and has, in place, a good management team that works well together and understands the client, the SBM employees, and the daily ins and outs associated with the job.\n\nThe more time that passes by without her placement and being the one responsible and held accountable, I believe has a negative impact on her abilities to be a Manager of a site her own. She is NOT utilizing the things that she learned in the program. UKG/UTA, IN Suite, and does not have the engagement with the other branches of the business like procurement, HR, Payroll, CC. These are skills or tools that are polished by using them. When you are not, they become dull."

His perfect scores in soft skills reflect his natural leadership presence and collaborative spirit.\n\nKey Strengths:\n• Exceptional problem-solving under pressure\n• Strong operational knowledge and safety awareness\n• Natural communicator who builds rapport quickly\n• Takes initiative without prompting\n• Adapts seamlessly to changing priorities\n\nDevelopment Opportunities:\n• Continue building experience with budget management\n• Expand knowledge of advanced scheduling systems\n\nOverall Assessment: Evan is already taking on independent responsibilities with confidence and shows readiness for accelerated progression into site management. His consistent high performance, combined with his enthusiasm for learning, makes him an ideal candidate for priority placement opportunities. I have full confidence in his ability to succeed in an Assistant Operations Manager role or higher. Highly recommend for immediate consideration."
